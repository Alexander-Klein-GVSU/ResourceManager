# ResourceManager
This is a small project I did for my Operating Systems Concepts class. When run, it simulates the allocation of resources to different processes and shows one potential order of
 operaton that does not result in a deadlock. If the current allocation of resources results in a deadlock, the program will also let the user know of this.      
 How to run:
 - Download the project and associated files into a python DE.
 - Run the .py file.
 - When the first diagram opens up, click inside of it to close it and open the next one.
